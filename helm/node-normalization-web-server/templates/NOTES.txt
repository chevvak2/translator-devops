1. Several RENCI services depend on NodeNorm running with a particular service
   name, so please don't change either the release name (`nn-web`) or
   the namespace without checking with Yaphet or whoever is running Aragorn and
   other RENCI Translator services.
2. The RENCI exp instance should be called `nn-exp` and should be hosted at
   https://nodenormalization-dev.apps.renci.org/docs.
3. The RENCI test instance (`nn-test`) is reserved for one-off testing. If
   you see it, please check on Slack whether anyone is using it before
   deleting it!
